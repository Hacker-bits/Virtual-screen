 First open both the files in the folder 'Virtual pen' 
 Run the 'value finder.py' file and adjust the dials such that only that colour/object is visible that you want to be used as a marker 
 Note the respective values and press 'esc' to exit
 Run 'Virtual pen(MAIN).py and adjust the sliders such that the values are same as he values that you have noted earlier
 Enjoy and to switch colour just take the marker over the block of colour that you want and same to clear the board.
 To exit just press 'Q'
HOPE YOU ENJOY !!!
